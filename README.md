 🔍 SQL + Power BI Project | End-to-End Data Analytics
I’m excited to share my latest data analytics project, where I analyzed India’s crime trends over 13 years using:
🗃️ Tools & Tech Stack:
 ✔️ MySQL – for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
 ✔️ Power BI – for creating interactive visual dashboards
 ✔️ DAX – to compute KPIs, growth rates, and drilldowns
🔍Project Highlights:
📌 Cleaned and structured a raw crime dataset using SQL
 📌 Created 30+ queries (Basic to Advanced) for insights
 📌 Built KPIs like:
Total Crimes
Top Crime Types
Top 10 States by Crime
 📌 Used Power BI to design a professional dashboard featuring:
Year-wise crime trends
State-wise distribution
Dynamic filters for Year, State, and Crime Type
 📌 Applied DAX to calculate:
Top states by crime count
Year-over-year comparisons
📈 Key Insights:
🔹 16M+ Total Crimes from 2001–2013
 🔹 Maharashtra, UP, and MP among top states by crime
